# Benchmarks
We generated and collected several reducer benchmarks here.

In ```collected```, we used [searchcode API](https://searchcode.com/api/) to look for reduce programs.
We search with the keyword ```public void reduce```, then collected the results which the type of 
```value``` parameter are numbers.

```runnable_number``` contains the benchmarks we collected with serachcode few years ago.

```self_written``` are some interesting reducer written by ourselves.

```random_generated``` contains benchmarks generated by ```generator.c```.
