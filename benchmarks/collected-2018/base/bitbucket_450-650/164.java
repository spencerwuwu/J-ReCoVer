/**
 * A {@link ForkJoinTask} with a completion action
 * performed when triggered and there are no remaining pending
 * actions. Uses of CountedCompleter are similar to those of other
 * completion based components (such as {@link
 * java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler}) except that multiple
 * <em>pending</em> completions may be necessary to trigger the {@link
 * #onCompletion} action, not just one. Unless initialized otherwise,
 * the {@link #getPendingCount pending count} starts at zero, but may
 * be (atomically) changed using methods {@link #setPendingCount},
 * {@link #addToPendingCount}, and {@link
 * #compareAndSetPendingCount}. Upon invocation of {@link
 * #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is
 * decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if
 * this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued
 * with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization
 * components such as {@link Phaser} and {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} these methods affect only internal
 * counts; they do not establish any further internal bookkeeping. In
 * particular, the identities of pending tasks are not maintained. As
 * illustrated below, you can create subclasses that do record some or
 * all pended tasks or their results when needed.
 *
 * <p>A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link
 * #compute}, that should, in almost all use cases, invoke {@code
 * tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also optionally
 * override method {@link #onCompletion} to perform an action upon
 * normal completion, and method {@link #onExceptionalCompletion} to
 * perform an action upon any exception.
 *
 * <p>CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case
 * they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter<Void>}, and
 * will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,
 * you should override method {@link #getRawResult} to provide a
 * result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods. (Method
 * {@link #setRawResult} by default plays no role in CountedCompleters
 * but may be overridden for example to maintain fields holding result
 * data.)
 *
 * <p>A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,
 * one for which {@link #getCompleter} returns {@code null}) can be
 * used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.
 * However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves
 * only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task
 * status (as reported in methods such as {@link ForkJoinTask#isDone})
 * is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of
 * {@link #complete}, {@link ForkJoinTask#cancel}, {@link
 * ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally} or upon exceptional completion
 * of method {@code compute}. Upon any exceptional completion, the
 * exception may be relayed to a task's completer (and its completer,
 * and so on), if one exists and it has not otherwise already
 * completed.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usages.</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Parallel recursive decomposition.</b> CountedCompleters may
 * be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link
 * RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting
 * them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its
 * parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more
 * bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying
 * a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further
 * subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially
 * when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time
 * to complete for some elements than others, either because of
 * intrinsic variation (for example IO) or auxiliary effects such as
 * garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own
 * continuations, other threads need not block waiting to perform
 * them.
 *
 * <p> For example, here is an initial version of a class that uses
 * divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into single
 * pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual calls,
 * tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly forking
 * leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication and
 * improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of each
 * pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of its parent
 * (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op
 * implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden). A
 * static utility method sets up the base task and invokes it:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class MyOperation<E> { void apply(E e) { ... }  }
 *
 * class ForEach<E> extends CountedCompleter<Void> {
 *
 *     public static <E> void forEach(ForkJoinPool pool, E[] array, MyOperation<E> op) {
 *         pool.invoke(new ForEach<E>(null, array, op, 0, array.length));
 *     }
 *
 *     final E[] array; final MyOperation<E> op; final int lo, hi;
 *     ForEach(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyOperation<E> op, int lo, int hi) {
 *         super(p);
 *         this.array = array; this.op = op; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     }
 *
 *     public void compute() { // version 1
 *         if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *             int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *             setPendingCount(2); // must set pending count before fork
 *             new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
 *             new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).fork(); // left child
 *         }
 *         else if (hi > lo)
 *             op.apply(array[lo]);
 *         tryComplete();
 *     }
 * } }</pre>
 *
 * This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,
 * the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can
 * directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog
 * of tail recursion removal.)  Also, because the task returns upon
 * executing its left task (rather than falling through to invoke
 * tryComplete) the pending count is set to one:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class ForEach<E> ...
 *     public void compute() { // version 2
 *         if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *             int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *             setPendingCount(1); // only one pending
 *             new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
 *             new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke
 *         }
 *         else {
 *             if (hi > lo)
 *                 op.apply(array[lo]);
 *             tryComplete();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * As a further improvement, notice that the left task need not even
 * exist.  Instead of creating a new one, we can iterate using the
 * original task, and add a pending count for each fork:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class ForEach<E> ...
 *     public void compute() { // version 3
 *         int l = lo,  h = hi;
 *         while (h - l >= 2) {
 *             int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
 *             addToPendingCount(1);
 *             new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, h).fork(); // right child
 *             h = mid;
 *         }
 *         if (h > l)
 *             op.apply(array[l]);
 *         tryComplete();
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Additional improvements of such classes might entail precomputing
 * pending counts so that they can be established in constructors,
 * specializing classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four,
 * instead of two per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold
 * instead of always subdividing down to single elements.
 *
 * <p><b>Recording subtasks.</b> CountedCompleter tasks that combine
 * results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results
 * in method {@link #onCompletion}. As illustrated in the following
 * class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings
 * and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in
 * divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its
 * sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.
 * This technique applies to reductions in which the order of
 * combining left and right results does not matter; ordered
 * reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of
 * other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class MyMapper<E> { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }
 * class MyReducer<E> { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }
 * class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {
 *     final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;
 *     final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;
 *     MapReducer<E> sibling;
 *     E result;
 *     MapReducer(CountedCompleter p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,
 *                MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi) {
 *         super(p);
 *         this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
 *         this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     }
 *     public void compute() {
 *         if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *             int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *             MapReducer<E> left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);
 *             MapReducer<E> right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);
 *             left.sibling = right;
 *             right.sibling = left;
 *             setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending
 *             right.fork();
 *             left.compute();     // directly execute left
 *         }
 *         else {
 *             if (hi > lo)
 *                 result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);
 *             tryComplete();
 *         }
 *     }
 *     public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter caller) {
 *         if (caller != this) {
 *            MapReducer<E> child = (MapReducer<E>)caller;
 *            MapReducer<E> sib = child.sibling;
 *            if (sib == null || sib.result == null)
 *                result = child.result;
 *            else
 *                result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);
 *         }
 *     }
 *     public E getRawResult() { return result; }
 *
 *     public static <E> E mapReduce(ForkJoinPool pool, E[] array,
 *                                   MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {
 *         return pool.invoke(new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper,
 *                                              reducer, 0, array.length));
 *     }
 * } }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Triggers.</b> Some CountedCompleters are themselves never
 * forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;
 * including those in which the completion of one of more async tasks
 * triggers another async task. For example:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
 * class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
 * class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter<...> {
 *     PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion
 *     public void compute() { } // never called
 *     public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter<?> caller) { sendPacket(); }
 * }
 * // sample use:
 * PacketSender p = new PacketSender();
 * new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 * new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 * }</pre>
