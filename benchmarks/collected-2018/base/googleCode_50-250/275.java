 * of them in some useful way to reduce work and complexity. For example, if you have a feature that
 * corresponds to the spanned text of a word and you want to a feature that corresponds to the
 * lowercased spanned text of the same word, then you could use the
 * LowerCaseProliferator.proliferate() method. The same feature proliferator could be used to get a
 * lowercase version of an feature that has a StringValue.
