/**
 * Creates a registry of members using a {@link IMap}. The user can create a {@link EntryListener} for
 * receiving events from the IMap wich inform of joining or leaving members. Some update events can be
 * generated, because of change in the information, or as cause of some re-registerings that are done for
 * safety. <br>
 * Main difficulty with the registry is the case of network partitions, or split-brain. In this case, all
 * registry replicas of one member could be lost. It is an improbable case, but possible. For this case,
 * we have a thread that periodically check that the node is registered so assuring eventual consistency.
 * </br> Another design principle of this registry is the idea of trying to minimize network
 * communication between nodes, as that could affect the system scalability.
