     * This operation returns one or more data records from a shard. A
     * <code>GetRecords</code> operation request can retrieve up to 10 MB of
     * data.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You specify a shard iterator for the shard that you want to read data
     * from in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard iterator
     * specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start
     * reading data records sequentially. A shard iterator specifies this
     * position using the sequence number of a data record in the shard. For
     * more information about the shard iterator, see GetShardIterator.

     * <code>GetRecords</code> may return a partial result if the response

     * result if the shard's provisioned throughput is exceeded, the shard
     * iterator has expired, or an internal processing failure has occurred.
     * Clients can request a smaller amount of data by specifying a maximum
     * number of returned records using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. The
     * <code>Limit</code> parameter can be set to an integer value of up to
     * 10,000. If you set the value to an integer greater than 10,000, you
     * will receive <code>InvalidArgumentException</code> .

     * request in <code>NextShardIterator</code> , which you use in the
     * <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next
     * <code>GetRecords</code> request. When you repeatedly read from an
     * Amazon Kinesis stream use a GetShardIterator request to get the first
     * shard iterator to use in your first <code>GetRecords</code> request
     * and then use the shard iterator returned in
     * <code>NextShardIterator</code> for subsequent reads.

     * <code>SplitShard</code> is called when there is a need to increase the
     * overall capacity of stream because of an expected increase in the
     * volume of data records being ingested.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SplitShard</code> can also be used when a given shard appears
     * to be approaching its maximum utilization, for example, when the set
     * of producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending
     * more than previously anticipated. You can also call the
     * <code>SplitShard</code> operation to increase stream capacity, so that
     * more Amazon Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the
     * stream for real-time processing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>SplitShard</code> operation requires that you specify the
     * shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the
     * shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash
     * key might simply be the average of the beginning and ending hash key,
     * but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the
     * shard. For more information about splitting shards, see the

     * and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the
     * UPDATING state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the
     * stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code> . If the stream
     * is in the ACTIVE state, you can call <code>SplitShard</code> . If a
     * stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or DELETING states, then Amazon

    /**
     * <p>
     * This operation merges two adjacent shards in a stream and combines
     * them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and
     * transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the
     * hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps.
     * For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of
     * 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you
     * could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a
     * hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard
     * receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent
     * shards.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the
     * overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not
     * being used. The operation requires that you specify the shard to be
     * merged and the adjacent shard for a given stream. For more information
     * about merging shards, see the
     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/"> Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide </a>
     * .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call
     * <code>MergeShards</code> . If a stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or
     * DELETING states, then Amazon Kinesis returns a
     * <code>ResourceInUseException</code> . If the specified stream does not
     * exist, Amazon Kinesis returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>
     * .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use the DescribeStream operation to check the state of the
     * stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving
     * a <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns
     * a response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to UPDATING. After
     * the operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the
     * <code>StreamStatus</code> to ACTIVE. Read and write operations
     * continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You use the DescribeStream operation to determine the shard IDs that
     * are specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using
     * CreateStream, DeleteStream, <code>MergeShards</code> or SplitShard,
     * you will receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>MergeShards</code> has limit of 5 transactions per second per
     * account.
