/**
 * Alters Map Generator timing to reduce power line noise. <BR><BR>
 * 
 * This capability allows a Map Generator to time its frame in such a manner that
 * interference from power line frequency (ie electric mains) noise is minimized
 * or eliminated.<BR><BR>
 * 
 * Common AC power lines emit electromagnetic radiation at their base frequency (usually 50-60 Hz), as
 * well as creating power supply noise in any electronics using AC power.  This noise spike is the 
 * source of the familiar 50 or 60 Hertz "hum" heard near power transformers.  This noise can also induce
 * artifacts in image sensors.  This capability is intended to inform a device of the dominant AC power frequency
 * in its current area of operation.  Some devices can use this information to optimize timing of internal 
 * image sensors to minimize the effects of this noise.<BR><BR>  
 * 
 * Available nominal power line frequencies are 50 hertz, 60 hertz, or 0 hertz (capability off).  This 
 * is intended to cover the most common AC frequencies used by the power utilities in 
 * most countries.<BR><BR>
 * 
 * Power in North America, most of South America, Taiwan and Korea is 60 hertz.  Europe, Australia, China and 
 * the Middle East are mostly 50 hertz. Most but not all African countries use 50 hertz.  Japan uses both.
 * Antarctica remains mostly uncovered by an electric grid, though isolated systems can be found using
 * both 50 Hz and 60 Hz.
