     * This operation splits a shard into two new shards in the stream, to
     * increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data.
     * <code>SplitShard</code> is called when there is a need to increase the
     * overall capacity of stream because of an expected increase in the
     * volume of data records being ingested.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SplitShard</code> can also be used when a given shard appears
     * to be approaching its maximum utilization, for example, when the set
     * of producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending
     * more than previously anticipated. You can also call the
     * <code>SplitShard</code> operation to increase stream capacity, so that
     * more Amazon Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the
     * stream for real-time processing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>SplitShard</code> operation requires that you specify the
     * shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the
     * shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash
     * key might simply be the average of the beginning and ending hash key,
     * but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the
     * shard. For more information about splitting shards, see the
     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/"> Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide </a>
     * .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use the DescribeStream operation to determine the shard ID
     * and hash key values for the <code>ShardToSplit</code> and
     * <code>NewStartingHashKey</code> parameters that are specified in the
     * <code>SplitShard</code> request.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SplitShard</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving
     * a <code>SplitShard</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns
     * a response and sets the stream status to UPDATING. After the operation
     * is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status to ACTIVE. Read
     * and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the
     * UPDATING state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the
     * stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code> . If the stream
     * is in the ACTIVE state, you can call <code>SplitShard</code> . If a
     * stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or DELETING states, then Amazon
     * Kinesis returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the specified stream does not exist, Amazon Kinesis returns a
     * <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> . If you try to create more
     * shards than are authorized for your account, you receive a
     * <code>LimitExceededException</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> The default limit for an AWS account is 10 shards per
     * stream. If you need to create a stream with more than 10 shards,

     * to increase the limit on your account.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using
     * CreateStream, DeleteStream, MergeShards or SplitShard, you will
