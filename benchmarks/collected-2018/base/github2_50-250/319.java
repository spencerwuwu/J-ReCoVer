/**
 * Aggregates values over all vertices at specified intervals. This is analogous
 * to performing map-reduce on the graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To use, provide an implementation that overrides
 * {@link #exec(Context, Vertex)}, {@link #add(Aggregator)}, {@link #clone()},
 * and {@link #finalize(long)}. Then, pass an instance of your aggregator to
 * {@link Core#addAggregator(String, Aggregator, long)}, specifying the
 * frequency at which you want the aggregator to be initiated. When your
 * aggregator is run, <tt>exec</tt> will be invoked on every vertex, and
 * <tt>add</tt> will be invoked to merge the results of two aggregators.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Generics</h3>
 * <p>
 * Most of the time, <tt>V</tt> will take the type of vertex that your graph has
 * and <tt>A</tt> will take the type of your aggregator. Your class signature
 * should look like the following:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   private static class Agg extends Aggregator&lt;AlsVertex, Agg&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>We recommend that you follow this pattern closely, unless you are very
 * familiar with generics.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 * <p>The complete source for this example is available as {@link org.graphlab.demo.Sum}.</p>
 * <p>Suppose we would like to sum over all vertices in the graph. To do so, we
 * implement an aggregator as follows:</p>
<pre>
  private static class SumAggregator extends Aggregator<ScalarVertex, SumAggregator> {

    private int sum;
    
    protected void add(SumAggregator agg) {
      sum += agg.sum;
    }

    protected SumAggregator clone() {
      SumAggregator agg = new SumAggregator();
      agg.sum = sum;
      return agg;
    }

    protected void exec(Context context, ScalarVertex vertex) {
      sum += vertex.value();
    }

    protected void finalize(Context context) {
      System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
    
  }
</pre>
 * <p>Then, to add it to the core and manually execute it, we use</p>
<pre>
  core.addAggregator("agg", new SumAggregator(), 0);
  core.aggregateNow("agg");
</pre>
 * <p>Instead of using 0 in the third parameter, you may also specify the
 * frequency at which the aggregator should be executed. For more information,
 * refer to {@link Core#addAggregator}.</p>
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *          Vertex type that will be used in {@link #exec(Context, Vertex)}.
 * @param <A>
 *          For self-templating.
