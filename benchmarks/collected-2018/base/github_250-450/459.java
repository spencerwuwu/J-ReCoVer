/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.AmazonKinesis#mergeShards(MergeShardsRequest) MergeShards operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation merges two adjacent shards in a stream and combines
 * them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and
 * transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the
 * hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps.
 * For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of
 * 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you
 * could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a
 * hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard
 * receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent
 * shards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the
 * overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not
 * being used. The operation requires that you specify the shard to be
 * merged and the adjacent shard for a given stream. For more information
 * about merging shards, see the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/"> Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call
 * <code>MergeShards</code> . If a stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or
 * DELETING states, then Amazon Kinesis returns a
 * <code>ResourceInUseException</code> .
 * If the specified stream does not exist, Amazon Kinesis
 * returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the DescribeStream operation to check the state of the
 * stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving
 * a <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns
 * a response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to UPDATING. After
 * the operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the
 * <code>StreamStatus</code> to ACTIVE. Read and write operations
 * continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You use the DescribeStream operation to determine the shard IDs that
 * are specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using
 * CreateStream, DeleteStream, <code>MergeShards</code> or SplitShard,
 * you will receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>MergeShards</code> has limit of 5 transactions per second per
 * account.
 * </p>
