 * Asynchronous client for accessing AWSStorageGateway.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * AWS Storage Gateway Service <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration
 * between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS
 * cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.
